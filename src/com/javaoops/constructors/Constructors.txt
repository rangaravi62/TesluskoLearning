Constructor :
constructor is a specialized setter which has the class name.it doesn't have any return type
a constructor gets invoked during the creation of an object

by default jvm will include a default constructor in all the classes
if we use any parametrized contructors then jvm will not include default contructor we need to manually include

by default behind the scenes every constructor will have super() method in the first line
super() :
super method is used to call parent class constructor

ex :
public Constructor1(int age,String name ){
        super();
        this.age = age;
        this.name = name;
}

this() :
this() method is used to call the current class constructor
this() method should be declared in the first line of the constuctor this is mandatory if we want to use
and this() method can only be used in the constructors

ex :
public ThisAndSuper(int a, int b) {
        this(a,b,10); // calling a parametrized constructor which takes in three args from a 2 arg constructor
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
}
