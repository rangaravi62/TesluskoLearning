Encapsulation :
providing security to the most important component of the object by giving controlled access on it
we can acheive this by making the variables private and restricting the access to the other classes
other classes can only access them through getters and setters.

ex:

public class Books1 {
    private int pgNo;

    public int getPgNo() {
        return pgNo;
    }

    public void setPgNo(int pgNo) {
        if(!(pgNo < 0)){
            this.pgNo = pgNo;
        }else {
            System.out.println("pgNo cannot be in negative you dumb!");
        }

    }

}

this keyword :

we use 'this' keyword to differentiate instance variable and the value passed in a setter or in a constructor
'this' keyword holds the reference of currently running object
